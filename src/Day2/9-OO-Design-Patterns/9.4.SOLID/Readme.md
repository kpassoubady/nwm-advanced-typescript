# SOLID Principles

## Principles

| Principle                                 | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`   | A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.          |
| `Open/Closed Principle (OCP)`             | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.                                    |
| `Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)`     | Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program. |
| `Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`   | Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.                                 |
| `Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)`    | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.                 |
